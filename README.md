# Siri-Audible-Drone-Preflight
Siri Shortcut for an Audible Preflight Checklist for Drone Pilots

# Setup
1. Create a list in the Reminders app called "Preflight Checklist"
2. Open both "UAS Preflight Checklist.shortcut" and "Preflight Weather Briefing.shortcut"
3. Add both shortcuts to the Shortcuts app
4. Run UAS Preflight Checklist, allow permissions as requested for reading/editing lists, requesting location, and writing files.

# Use
Preflight Checklist will read from your "Preflight Checklist" Reminder list and listen for you to say "Check". If you say anything else, such as "Skip", the item will not be checked and you will later have the option to come back and run through the missed items.
After running the checklist, each item is recorded into the "Preflight Log.txt" file, which should be saved in your "Shortcuts" folder in iCloud. A timestamp marks when it was run.
